necessary to remove the nucleon(s) in question from the
nucleus.
S2p: 2-proton separation energy
Sn: 1-neutron separation energy
Sp - 1-proton separation energy
Binding energy per nucleon: For target, compound, daughter nuclei. Measured in keV.

Mass excess Difference between nuclide mass and sum of constituent
nucleons, for TCD nuclei.
Z even Nucleon number parity is considered important in capture
cross sections [46]
